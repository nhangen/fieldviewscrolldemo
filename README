This project shows how to effectively scroll a scrollView that has UITextFields and UITextViews so that the keyboard does not cover the UITextField or UITextView. If a UITextView is too large to fit in the remaining view, after the keyboard is displayed then the textView is resized to fit.  To move from textView to textField, simply scroll.
